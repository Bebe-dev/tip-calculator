## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

The task was mainly for me to practice JavaSript which it did. I was able to practice some CSS with the active states and hover. I also had to manipulate some of the syling with JavaScript


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com)
- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Both websites helped greatly with remembering some forgotten concepts.
